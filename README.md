# java-swing-tombala

<h1>About the Project</h1>
There are many games about bingo, however I haven't found one specific for Tombala. Knowing some basic Java and the Swing toolkit I have created a basic Tombala number picker.

<h2>View in Java Swing</h2>
I wanted something pleasant to look at, since especially Tombala is a game played as a group. I came up with the idea of using an isometric 3d field, to display each randomly picked stone for playing Bingo/Tombala using Java Swing. The isometric view looks 45 degrees down and gives the illusion of 3D perspective.

<h2>Final Comments</h2>
To be able to play upto 90 stones (default is 100), you will need to change GameLogic size = 90, and also the width of IsometricMap to a 9 (width*height = 9*10 = 90 tiles) before compilation.
